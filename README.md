# Real-Time-Speech-recognition

Speech to Text for Transcription Services
This project provides a notebook-based solution for converting speech audio files into text transcriptions, suitable for transcription services and related applications.

Features

Converts speech audio files to text using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Supports audio preprocessing, including noise reduction and feature extraction.

Utilizes popular libraries such as transformers, torchaudio, and librosa.

Designed for easy experimentation and extension within a Jupyter/Colab environment.

Requirements

The following Python packages are required (as seen in the notebook setup):

kaggle

transformers

torch (version 2.6.0)

torchaudio

librosa

noisereduce

matplotlib

scikit-learn

numpy

scipy

soundfile

joblib

numba

Other dependencies such as requests, tqdm, python-dateutil, and NVIDIA CUDA libraries for GPU acceleration

All major dependencies are installed at the start of the notebook to ensure a smooth setup.

Usage

Setup: Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab. All required packages are installed automatically in the first cell.

Input Audio: Upload or specify the path to your audio files.

Preprocessing: The notebook applies noise reduction and feature extraction to prepare the audio for transcription.

Transcription: The notebook uses a pretrained model (via the transformers library) to convert speech to text.

Results: The transcribed text is displayed or saved for further use.

How It Works

Audio Preprocessing: Uses librosa and noisereduce to clean and prepare audio data.

Model Inference: Leverages Hugging Face's transformers library for speech-to-text conversion, likely using models such as Wav2Vec2 or Whisper.

Postprocessing: Outputs are formatted for easy reading or further analysis.

Getting Started

Clone or download the notebook.

Ensure you have a compatible Python environment (Python 3.11+ recommended).

Run the notebook cells in order.

For GPU acceleration, ensure your environment supports CUDA 12.x.

Notes

The notebook is suitable for research, prototyping, and small-scale transcription tasks.

For large-scale or production deployments, consider packaging the workflow into scripts or a web service.
